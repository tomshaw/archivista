A command-line application for quickly backing up your databases. It supports exporting multiple databases in a single operation, runs asynchronously and is extremely fast. Outputs export information as each operation completes. Tested on moderate to large size databases without any problems.

## Features

- Export all your database in a single operation.
- Supports `mysql`, `postgres` and `sqlserver`.
- Runs asynchronously, and is extremely fast.
- Exclude selected databases from the backup.
- Prints exports sorted by duration in a colorized table.

## Usage

1. Set the following environment variables:

    - `DB_CONNECTION`: The type of server. Use `mysql`, `postgres` or `sqlserver`.
    - `DB_HOST`: The hostname of your server.
    - `DB_PORT`: The port number of your server.
    - `DB_USERNAME`: The username to use when connecting to your server.
    - `DB_PASSWORD`: The password to use when connecting to your server.
    - `DB_EXPORTS`: A comma-separated list of databases to backup. Use `*` to backup all databases.
    - `DB_FORGETS`: A comma-separated list of databases to exclude from the backup.

2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
